Good old fashioned game of Mario, set with some of the games oldest graphics. The goal of the game is simple, 
get to the end of the map and reach the flag while avoiding enemies and falling into holes. The character supports the 
following actions - Jumping, Running (Right/Left), and Crouching. Enemies can be eliminated by jumping 
on top of them. All structures can be jumped on and should be utilized for success! 

Goodluck and have fun!
